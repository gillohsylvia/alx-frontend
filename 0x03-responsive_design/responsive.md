## Viewport
The viewport is a meta seen in our first HTML advanced module. The width=device-width forces mobile browsers to adopt their real viewport width.

## Code example
```
<head>
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover">
</head>
```

Code example
```
*, *:before, *:after {
